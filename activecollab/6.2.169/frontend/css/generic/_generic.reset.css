/**
 * This is copy/paste from tailwind base.
 * 
 * Allow adding a border to an element by just adding a border-width.
 *
 * By default, the way the browser specifies that an element should have no
 * border is by setting it's border-style to `none` in the user-agent
 * stylesheet.
 *
 * In order to easily add borders to elements by just setting the `border-width`
 * property, we change the default border-style for all elements to `solid`, and
 * use border-width to hide them instead. This way our `border` utilities only
 * need to set the `border-width` property instead of the entire `border`
 * shorthand, making our border utilities much more straightforward to compose.
