{lang}Yaay, you just moved in into your new workspace!{/lang}
================================================================================
{notification_logo}

<p>We always encourage a shift from all work in all places to <strong>all work in one place.</strong><br>
Before you start, let's give your workspace a bit of furbish.<br></p>
<p>Make yourself at home:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add your photo</li>
    <li>Choose your favorite color scheme</li>
    <li>Pick your time-zone</li>
    <li>Change the language</li>
</ul></p>
<p><a href="https://app.activecollab.com/{$payload.account_id}/profile">Go to your profile settings</a></p>

<p>To help you get started, instead of cupcakes, we made a couple of sample projects. Unlike cupcakes, they can't go bad! You can test how the software works without the fear of breaking anything. They have shown to be a great way for getting on friendly terms with ActiveCollab.</p>
<p>In case you didn't import sample projects at the beginning, or you want to test more of them, they will always be available.</p>
